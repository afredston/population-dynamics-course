# Population dynamics teaching notes
## Alexa Fredston, Ocean Sciences, UCSC

Currently taught as OCEA165 / OCEA265, Marine Population Dynamics, at UCSC. Students enrolled in those courses are welcome to access anything in this repository, but should plan to take their own notes; these are my board teaching notes and may change without warning. 

You are welcome to reuse these notes and/or homeworks in your teaching and learning. If you do so, please tell me (email fredston@ucsc.edu) so I can track the impact of my work. 

These notes are heavily drawn from the following sources, which I acknowledge with great appreciation: 

* Alan Hastings' book, "Population Biology: Concepts and Models"
* Marissa Baskett's ESP121 course notes (UC Davis)
* Dave Tilman's UCSB course ESM201, for which I was a TA
* chatGPT, which generated a lot of the Quarto code for the math.
